# Access-to-drinking-water
This spreadsheet project explores global access to drinking water using data analysis and pivot tables. It examines trends by region, income group, and rural vs. national access. Key metrics like Annual Rate of Change (ARC) help identify where progress is slow or declining. The goal is to support efforts toward UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

 Key Features

- Cleaned and structured raw data for analysis
- Calculated **Annual Rate of Change (ARC)** for rural and national access
- Used **pivot tables and charts** to compare access by region and income level
- Applied functions like `IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `ROUND`, and `FILTER`
- Summarized countries with full access and those with declining trends
  
   Files Included

- Some low-income countries show negative ARC, indicating worsening conditions
- Urbanization is positively correlated with improved access
