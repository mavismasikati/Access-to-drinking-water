# Access-to-drinking-water
This spreadsheet project explores global access to drinking water using data analysis and pivot tables. It examines trends by region, income group, and rural vs. national access. Key metrics like Annual Rate of Change (ARC) help identify where progress is slow or declining. The goal is to support efforts toward UN SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
